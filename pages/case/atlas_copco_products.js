      <h2>Atlas Copco Products</h2>
        <p>
          Together with Graviz we made a group of sites for Atlas Copcoâ€™s range
          of mining machinery.

        <p>
          <a href="">Scooptram ST7</a><br/>
          <a href="">Boomer S2</a><br/>
          <a href="">Meyco ME5</a><br/>
          <a href="">Simba S7</a><br/>
          <a href="">Powered by Automation</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal was to for the interested to easily get
          in contact with the mining division and to educate the target group in
          a more accessible manner than the traditional pdf (though a pdf was also
          available for the more conservative via a download form).
        </p>
        <p>
          We created a stringent devops strategy to make sure development and
          deployment was as  efficient and easy as possible and combined with a
          modular approach to writing code made the creation and rollout of each
          new site a piece of cake.
